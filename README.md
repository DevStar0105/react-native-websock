1) run `./bin/generateLib` to generate the client Primus Library we'll be using in our React Native Client.
2) Explore `./components/client` to see the (almost) 1-for-1 port of DevStarClient JS library (which is generated by the DevStar server for browser clients from [this](https://github.com/DevStar/DevStar/blob/master/client/DevStarClient.js) template)

run the example (`npm run ios`)!
